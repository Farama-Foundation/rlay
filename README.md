Rlay is a simple library for creating new Farama projects, following the structure of Gymnasium. 

We have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/bnJ6kubTg6

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up a new project which follows the Farama standards:

1. Clone (or otherwise download) rlay to your local system.
2. Navigate into the directory you just created.
3. Run `bash initialize.sh`.
4. Enter the name of your new project.
5. Run `cd ../<project-name>`, where `<project-name>` is the same as you entered above.
6. Your project is now ready for development!
